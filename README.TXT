Note from Guillermo: 
  I think I got the code to a functional state. 
  Keep writing your code in the way you've been doing and it should work
  Remember that the ending uses the ending variable and not the player input variable, and you should be fine
  I would highly suggest testing the code in eclipse of BlueJay before you go home today, see if everything fits
  Don't try to make any fundemental changes to the code this late in the game, unless it doesn't run right, or you know what your doing
